Overview

This is a simple clone of the popular mobile game Angry Birds developed using Swift, spriteKit and coreData. This game is a game where players launch birds with a slingshot to destroy and 
taking down the structures and the boxes. This README provides information on its features and mechanics.

What I learned&used: 
Physics:
I learned how to use spritekit basics at swift, the phscicsBody parametres and used them, How to move an object and how to detect and react collisions.  I also added a scoreCounter which shows you how many boxes that your bird destroyed.


CoreData: 
I used CoreData for changing the bird. 


TableView: 
I also used the tableView for changing the bird, I get the datas from coreData.



You can check the photos and videos about the game at calmBird/READMEMEDIA.
